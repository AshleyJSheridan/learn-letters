# Learn Letters Web App

This app was originall built for my eldest son to help him learn the letters of the alphabet using the [Web Speech Synthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API#speech_synthesis).

## Requirements

* PHP
* SASS

## Building the App

1. Build the SASS with `sass sass/styles.scss:css/styles.css` from the root of the project.
1. Deploy code to a server capable of executing PHP (the one built into PHP can work but is not recommended for public access)
